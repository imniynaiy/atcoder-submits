1.	Type S of the Monoid:

S is the type used for the values stored in the segment tree. It could be an int, pair, or any custom struct, depending on what the segment tree is meant to store (like sums, minimums, or maximums of intervals).

2.	Binary Operation S op(S a, S b):

This function defines how to combine two segments. For example, if the segment tree is for range sums, op(a, b) could be a + b. If it’s for range minimums, it might be min(a, b).

3.	Identity Element S e():

e() returns the identity element for the binary operation op. This is the element that doesn’t affect results when combined with others. For example, in summation, e() is 0 because x + 0 = x. For minimums, it could be ∞ (or a very large value) since min(x, ∞) = x.

4.	Type F of the Map:

F is the type of the lazy propagation function, or “lazy tag.” This is typically the type of the data that will be applied to the range, such as an integer for addition or a pair for complex updates.

5.	Mapping Function S mapping(F f, S x):

This function applies a value of type F (the lazy tag) to a segment value S x. It defines how an update (like an addition or a set operation) affects an individual segment element. For example, in a range addition, mapping(f, x) might be x + f.

6.	Composition Function F composition(F f, F g):

This function combines two update functions (f and g) into a single function. It determines how to merge two lazy operations when they are propagated. For example, if both updates are additions, then composition(f, g) could be f + g.

7.	Identity Function F id():

id() returns the identity element for lazy operations. It’s the element that does nothing when applied as an update, similar to e() for segment values. For instance, if f is an addition, id() might return 0 (no change).
